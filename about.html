      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Folz Farms is a backyard garden operation rooted in Deer Park, Ohio. What started as a hobby has grown into a family project led by Alex and Jennifer — and overseen by their Boston Terrier, Walter.</p>
      <p>From cucumbers to hot peppers to sweet peaches, everything is grown in our greenhouse, garden beds, and even a basement grow tent. What we harvest, we preserve: hand-crafted pickles, spicy relishes, and salsas full of flavor.</p>
      <p>We believe in small-batch, big-taste. From dirt to jar Folz Farms brings the flavor!</p>
